# DiagnalRNWorkshop

- search Textinput will be shown when click on search icon, and will reset when click on back button
- if scrolls faster there will be pause for loading next page data
- uploaded what ever I have done in around 3 hours
- values given in redlines didn't meet the design given, I tried to convert px to pt also, but the view didn't match, so my own values are given.
